Troubleshooting
Frontend Not Connecting to Backend:

Ensure the backend server is running at http://localhost:3000.
Check that the backend includes cors middleware:
javascript
 
 
const cors = require('cors');
app.use(cors());
Port Conflict:

If the default frontend port (3005) is in use, specify another port:
powershell
 
 
set PORT=3006 && npm start
Styling Issues:

Ensure all CSS files and dependencies are properly installed.
API Errors:

Verify the backend is functional by testing its endpoints (refer to the backend README).
