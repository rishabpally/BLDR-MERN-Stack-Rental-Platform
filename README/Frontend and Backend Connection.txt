Frontend and Backend Connection
The frontend connects to the backend via the API hosted on http://localhost:3000. Ensure both servers are running simultaneously:

Start the backend server in one terminal:
powershell
 
 
cd rental-platform-backend
node server.js
Start the frontend server in another terminal:
powershell
 
 
cd rental-platform-frontend
npm start
